# Full-Stack-App-with-React-and-a-REST-API

In this project, a user interface was created with React for a school database REST API. This full stack 
application provides a way for users to interact with the information held within the database. Users can 
view a list of the courses, and view each course's detail. Those who have an account can sign-in to their accounts to create, update, and delete their courses. If users don't have an account, they can easily sign-up.

This project uses React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App. 

How to initialize:

- Open text editor.
- Open API folder.
    - npm install 
    - npm start
    
- Open a second text editor window. 
- Open the client folder.
    - npm install
    - npm start
